# A Visual Map of Coral Bleaching and Disease Sites

https://mrajendiran.github.io/coralreef/

Coral reefs are diverse and complex ecosystems that support over 25% of all marine life. Anthropogenic global warming, overfishing, and pollution have extensively damaged these sensitive ecosystems. This visualization depicts the progressively worsening deterioration of reef systems, along with insight into prevalent diseases (for 2010s) that plague these unique, yet doomed, habitats. Severity is indicated on the map with red being High (>30% bleaching), orange being Medium (>10% bleaching), and yellow being Low (less than 10% bleaching).
